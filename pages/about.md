# About - Who?

Hi. My name is Lucyanna Paluk. I am currently studying Media, Journalism and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University. My hobbies and interests include going for coffee (a hazlenut latte), spending time with my (3!) cats, going on spontaneous adventures with friends, reading, travelling, walking in cites i've never been to before and, of course, writing. I am particualrly interested in writing about food, travel, the Environment, huge wordly issues such as Poverty and Feminism, Space and all things to do with animals.

## About - Why?

Looking back on my early years, I don't recall wanting to be anything other than a journalist. I find writing in a communicative, informative sense incredibly thrilling and exciting. I think being able to write a piece of writing that can completely alter someone's perceptions and opinions is groundbreaking. In short, I wish to write how I see the world from my perspective while being listened to and heard. Writing is my passion.

### About - What?

My goal for this blog is to be a educational, inspirational source of knowledge but also a place of leisure. I will be focusing particularly on the typographical design of magazines, newspapers and other journalistic formats such as Vogue, The Daily Mail and The Guardian. I will be analysing the fonts and the typographical voice they convey. Are they low contrast? Serifs? Tentative or emphatic? Luxury or squalor? Rigid or casual? I will be searching through these formats to find what voice they are trying to communicate.
