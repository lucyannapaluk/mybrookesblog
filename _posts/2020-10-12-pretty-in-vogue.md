The infamous Vogue lettering has always illustrated an air of sophistication, elegance and luxury. This is a clear parallel to the brands and products they advertise and feature within their magazines. Although Vogue has no official logo, it uses its masthead successfully as their global brand recognition. The high quality didone serif font is ultra chic and takes a modern approach, despite being designed in 1945.

Prior to this, type choices in Vogue differed between serif and sans serif but also interchanged regularly and took inspiration from the illustrations and print that were on the front cover of that issue.
